       "535  @goodtaxtakes I don't see what they COULD do, other than saying something they might regret.\\n\\nMcDonalds (for example) has 750 locations in Russia. I guess the dynamic differs depending whether they're franchises or corporate owned, and depending whether they care about alienating that market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

We can however get the number of friends/followers which has a much higher rate limit, supposedly around 300 requests every 15 minutes but it actually appears to be higher in practice, somewhere around 900/10 mins but this fluctuates."
