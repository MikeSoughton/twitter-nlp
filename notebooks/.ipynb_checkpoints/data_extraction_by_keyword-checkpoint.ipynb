       "380   @sophenwrites Thanks. I actually added it into my second book. There was a dog from history that I had incorporated into the story.

Again, so sorry you are going thru this. https://t.co/27HiZplO0K                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "657   Got kids to saw wood, put in a divider for the cargo area of the suv. Cooler fits under it, dogs still have room, and can put the walker on top. Eldest is cleaning interior windows as punishment which means I have to re-wax my back windows because she cleaned the outside there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "666   @scouty4 I’m so sorry for your loss.  I lost my precious girl almost 2 months ago, and I can’t go through it again.  I’ll babysit for friends dogs or cats, but I won’t have another pet of my own.  Again, I’m so very sorry.  He looks like he was a really good boy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
