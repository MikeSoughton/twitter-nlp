We present BotAegis; a Convulutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier 

## Overview

Currently there is much interest in using Machine Learning methods for detecting and identifying signals within HEP. However, little has so far been done towards the seemingly straightforward task of incorporating the results from these methods into statistical tests such as those used for discovery of new particles. Our paper demonstrates how to use the outputs of supervised classifiers or unsupervised anomaly detection methods can be used in Log-Likelihood Ratio hypothesis tests and in obtaining seperation and discovery significances.
