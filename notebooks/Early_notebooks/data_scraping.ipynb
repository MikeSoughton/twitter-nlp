    "- Number of followers\n",
    "- Number following (called friends in the API)\n",
    "- Potentially the names of follows\n",
    "- Potentially the number following\n",
    "- Potentially the location\n",
    "Whilst it would be great to get the names of at least some of a users followers and friends, getting them is severely limited by tweepys limit of 15 friends/followers requests of a user every 15 minutes. We can however get the number of friends/followers which has a much higher rate limit, supposedly around 300 requests every 15 minutes but it actually appears to be higher in practice, somewhere around 900/10 mins but this fluctuates."
